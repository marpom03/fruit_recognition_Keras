##**fruit image recognition - the first step in machine learning**

Designing a simple **convolutional neural network (CNN) model** for fruit image classification – bananas and oranges – using the **Keras** library in TensorFlow. The code is an example of the process of creating, training, and using the model.

The training set contains 440 images of bananas and an equal number of orange images. The test set contains 102 images each of bananas and oranges. They have been taken from various angles with different lighting and backgrounds. They were then specially prepared for training by standardizing their size, and orientation, and sharpening the edges.
